    <h1>Where did we feel more?</h1>

    <p>Around mid March of 2018 I hobbled in to San Serriffe and bought a book. A detour I make absolutely every time I head over to Amsterdam. But this time I was recommended a book called ‘are we human?’By Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley. That night shortly after getting home, I plopped down on my bed and began to read. I ripped through the first and second chapter until in the third ‘blows of design’, where I came across this image. I was the image Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley used to start talking about Darwin’s Desent of man and introduce the ‘Sexy Handaxe Theory’ by Dr Marek Kohn & Dr Steven Mithen.<br><br></p>

<p>
To be quick the way Colomina and Wigley painted a scene of our early ancestors creating design or designing tools merely for the purpose of being exhibited lit my face up with a smile. It was like I could see our ancestors find the perfect piece of flint and start to chip away at it until it became sharp bifacial handaxe. Then proceed to show it of like a peacock does with his vibrant iridescent plumage.<br><br>

After I finished the book, I looked in to Dr Marek Kohn & Dr Steven Mithen’s HANDAXES: PRODUCTS OF SEXUAL SELECTION?. I found that their paper was highly debated and controversial. Symmetry and humans: reply to Mithen's ‘Sexy Handaxe Theory’ by Derek Hodgson and The Case Against Sexual Selection as an Explanation of Handaxe Morphology by April Nowel and Melanie Lee Chang to mention a couple. This started me on a spree of reading and searching through archeological journals and papers about handaxes. Interestingly finding many situational stories about how or why our ancestors created and shaped these objects. Even stories of their frustration and emotion while making them. A portion of stories were in many ways relatable to myself, and all of them sparked my imagination flinging me back in time to feel and experience the reasons for their creation.<br><br>

For example in the process of creating a handaxe there is an event or happening at the final stage of creation called ‘end-shocking’. End shocking is a mistake when you make the ‘final’ blow but in some cases your handaxe can break or split in the process. The two parts were sometimes found in two different places, “the part that dropped to the floor remaining with the flakes from its creation, and the part that had temporarily remained in the knapper’s hand hurled several metres away in frustration (Smith 1894; Sampson 1978). According to Sampson’s analysis (1978, 146-148), this person was a novice; when another more experienced knapper made the same mistake, they calmly let the pieces fall to the ground.”</p><br><br>

Its this type of visualization of an experience surrounding this object which I find so lively and interesting. All of this gave me the urge to see as many as I could in person. Which lead me on somewhat of a handaxe pilgrimage. First, on a business trip to London I was able to take a day and walk around the city. So I chose to head to the Holy Grail, The British Museum. I knew they housed the famous Hoxne Handaxe found by John Frere which I first saw in ‘are we human?’ .  It was like meeting a pen pal from across the world, communicating only by letter. My emotions when I finally saw it were like “Hey you!”, I just wanted to hug it. Later I went to the Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow with no luck but next door in the Hunterian museum in side of the University of Glasgow I hit the jackpot, with a beautiful arrangement of hand tools. Lastly I headed over to Edinburgh to the National Scottish Museum where I found handaxe’s as well as the Towie ball or Carved stone balls found predominantly in Scotland. Another object with ultimately unknown purposes. The Towie ball then led me to other prehistoric objects where archeologists explain the history of the object through a story like description. My friend Sissel sent an email invite to her birthday party and at the top of the email sat the Makapansgat Pebble. The British museums website says this on its website.

“This rock was found in a cave with the remains of early human ancestors. It was probably collected three million years ago because its natural features make it look like a face. If this is the case, it is an early example of curiosity and it may be the earliest example of ‘found art’ anywhere in the world.”

<h1>Meeting my Pen-pal</h1><br>
<p>
When I was in London, I made a point to go to the British Museum. There was only one thing I wanted to see. When I first got there I thought I would wander around and eventually bump in to it. The first gallery I went through was Ancient Egypt. It had large scale sculptures which included stylized depictions of kings, deities and symbolics objects that ranged from the time of the old Kingdom to the middle of the Roman period. They also had The Rosetta Stone on display. It was all alright. I then proceeded through Africa, the Americas, China and South Asia, Korea and Japan, Ancient Greece and Rome, Europe, Assyrian sculpture and the incredibly massive Balawat Gates, through the rest of the Middle East. Pretty cool.

<br><br>
At this point I had a light sweat, and doubt started to creep in. There was one room left I hadn’t gone to, It was the Enlightenment Gallery. I started slow, walking to every little glass box like a blood hound. My pace increased, scrambling from one to the next. As I was about three fourths the way down the hall, I glanced to my left and saw a cheeky little piece of flint. I hustled over and darn near pressed my face against the glass.
<br><br>
John Hoxne
It was the Hoxne Handaxe found by John Frere in June of 1797! On the day of its discovery John was at the Hoxne clay brick pit. He was watching workers dig clay for the production of bricks. His attention was grabbed by the consistently pointed and shaped pieces of flint which workers were using to fill up potholes in the road. Frere recognized the the flint to be human tools (handaxes).

Body Change
I felt my posture start to change, and my hand went in to the position I thought it was meant to be held. I looked at all the ridges and flakes and pictured early humans concentrating and visualizing what a piece of stone could turn in to. It almost had a spirit, like it was tired of being cooped up in that glass box and after 400,000 years it wanted to be in the palm of someones hand.
